# Terminal Text

Terminal Text is a simple text editor that can be launched inside a terminal window. Terminal Text is a Laterna GUI and can be used in any terminal environment. There is limited functionality in Terminal Text, you can open and save files with only a few other minor features. There are two reasons for this; One, this was primarily a learning experience for myself and was never intended to be widely used. Two, Laterna is has limited functionality and there are other restrictions to adding functionality for a terminal environment which cannot be easily overcome by a single junior programmer such as myself in any reasonable amount of time.
