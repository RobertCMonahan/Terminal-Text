  Terminal Text is a simple text editor that can be
launched inside a terminal window. Terminal Text
is a Laterna based GUI and can be used in any
terminal environment. There is limited functionality
in Terminal Text, you can open and save files with
only a few other minor features. There are two
reasons for this; One, this was primarily a learning
experience for myself and was never intended to be
widely used. Two, Laterna is has limited functionality
and there are other restrictions to adding
functionality for a terminal environment which cannot
be easily overcome by a single junior programmer such
as myself in any reasonable amount of time.

Terminal Text was built by Robert C. Monahan. In
November 2016.
